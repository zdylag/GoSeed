## Style guide
### General
- Be inclusive, this is a project for everyone.
- Be descriptive, it can be hard to understand abbreviations or short-hand.

### GoLang
- Add tests for any new feature or bug fix, to ensure things continue to work.
- Comments should be full sentences, starting with a capital letter and ending with punctuation.
- Comments above a func or struct should start with the name of the thing being described.
- Wrap errors before returning with `oops.Wrapf(` to help build useful stacks for debugging.
- Early returns are great, they help reduce nesting!
- Avoid `interface{}` where possible, if we need such a generic please add a comment explaining what the real type is.

### Git
- Try to have an informative branch name for others eg. `LB-{issue number}-{ghusername}`.
  - Do not make pull requests from `main`.
  - Do not include slashes in your branch name.
    - Nested paths can act strange when other people start looking at your branch.
- Try to keep commit line length below 72 characters.
- All commit titles should be of the format `{area} {optional sub-area}: commit description`.
  - This will help people reading through commits quickly find the relevant ones.
  - Some examples might include:
    - `go data: add support for sorting by high-score`
    - `makefile: add docker build commands`
- Commits should be as [atomic](https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/atomic-commits/) as possible.
